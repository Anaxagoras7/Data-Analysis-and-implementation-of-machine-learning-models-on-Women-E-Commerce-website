# Data-Sentiment-Analysis-NLP-ML-models-implementation-on-Ecommerce-website-dataset

This project consists of a dataset from Ecommerce Website consisting of following:
  - Data Cleaning & Visualization
  - Percentages of Good and Bad Classes
  - Graphical analysis of Data using Seaborn
  - Data Processing - NLP & Sentiment Analysis
  - Machine Learning Models implemented:
    1) Bernoulli Naives- Bayes
    2) Random Forest
    3) KNN Classification
    4) Logistic Regression
    5) Multinomial Naive - Bayes
    6) TFIDF, GridSearchCV
    7) XGBOOST
    8) LinearSVC
    9) Decision Tree
    10) SGD Classifier
    11) RNN
    
Inference:
1. Looking at the analysis above, we can say that LOGISTIC REGRESSION is the best model from all the1. Looking at the analysis above, we can say that LOGISTIC REGRESSION is the best model from all the
    models because it has training accuracy of 99.64% and the testing accuracy of 97.27%. It is easy to
    implement and took less time to process the model.
2. Most of the users gave the Good review which is 77% of the total reviews.
3. Most of the users gave the Rating 5 out of 5.
4. The core age group that shop here is age 30-45 years. This age group are matured indivudals who
    cared about rating the product and mostly gave the rating of 5 and also found postive feedback helpful.
    Age group of above 70 didn't care much about the online rating, which is mostly because they are old.
    The age group of 15-20 which are teenagers cared less about rating the products and also the feedback
    didn't back their shopping choices.
